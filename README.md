Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)


# CodSoft Internship - CNN Image Classification  

This project was developed as part of my **Machine Learning Internship at CodSoft**, where I explored deep learning techniques for **image classification**. The goal was to build a **CNN-based model** capable of accurately categorizing images into different classes while experimenting with **transfer learning, data augmentation, and model optimization**.  

### ðŸ”¹ Project Overview  
- Built a **custom CNN model** to classify images from the **CIFAR-10 dataset** into 10 categories.  
- Implemented **data preprocessing techniques**, including normalization and augmentation, to improve model generalization.  
- Used **transfer learning** to enhance accuracy and reduce training time.  
- Achieved **65-70% accuracy** after fine-tuning the model with regularization and hyperparameter tuning.  
- Evaluated the model using **confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**, with visualizations to analyze performance.  

This project gave me hands-on experience in training and optimizing deep learning models while improving my understanding of **computer vision and neural networks**. It also reinforced my ability to work with frameworks like **TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV** to develop practical machine-learning applications.
