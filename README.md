Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)


# Teachnook Internship - CNN Image Classification  

This project was developed as part of my **Machine Learning Internship at Teachnook**, where I worked on image classification using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. The objective was to build a deep learning model that can accurately classify images into different categories by leveraging **transfer learning, data augmentation, and optimization techniques**.  

### ðŸ”¹ Project Overview  
- Designed and trained a **custom CNN model** for image classification using the **CIFAR-10 dataset**.  
- Applied **data preprocessing techniques** like normalization and augmentation to improve model performance.  
- Integrated **transfer learning** to enhance accuracy and optimize training time.  
- Achieved **65-70% accuracy** after fine-tuning with regularization and hyperparameter tuning.  
- Evaluated the model using **confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**, with visualizations for deeper analysis.  

This project gave me hands-on experience in **deep learning, computer vision, and neural networks** while working with frameworks like **TensorFlow, and Keras**. It strengthened my understanding of model training, evaluation, and optimization for real-world applications.
