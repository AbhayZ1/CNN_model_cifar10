Dataset
The project uses a custom dataset with images categorized into various classes. You can also use publicly available datasets like CIFAR-10 or ImageNet.

Model Architecture
The project uses a custom CNN architecture designed specifically for the image classification task.
Training Process
Dataset Collection: Gather a large dataset of labeled images.
Data Preprocessing: Resize, normalize, and split the images into training and testing sets.
Model Training: Train the CNN model using the training dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model using the testing dataset.
Model Optimization: Fine-tune the model with techniques like data augmentation and regularization.
Evaluation
The model is evaluated on a test dataset using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. A confusion matrix is also generated to visualize the performance across different classes alongwith a heatmap from the sns
Results
The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 65-70% on the test dataset after fine-tuning. The detailed performance metrics and confusion matrix are included in the evaluation section.

Usage
Training the Model:

Run the training script or Jupyter notebook to train the model.
